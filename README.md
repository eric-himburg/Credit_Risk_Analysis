# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Six different models were fit to real world data in order to determine which one best predicts credit risk.  Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem because good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Different techniques of machine learning were employed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.   

The credit dataset used in the modeling originated from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.  Python programming with the help of the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries was used to build and evaluate models using resampling.  The six different models to predict credit risk included 1) oversampling data using the RandomOverSampler and 2) SMOTE algorithms, 3) undersampling the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm, a 4) combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm, and finally two learning models that reduce bias, the 5) BalancedRandomForestClassifier and 6) EasyEnsembleClassifier. An evaluation of the performance of these models and a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk follows.
